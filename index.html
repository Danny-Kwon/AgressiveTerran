    <h2>Agressive Builds</h2>
    <p>
        It means, as literally, the game strategies that playing as we don't live for tomorrow. I recommend it if you are interested in teasing enemy to concentrate on their defense systems. Both of you would be very poor, but you can achieve victory in short time.
    </p>
    <h3 id="BBS">BBS</h3>
    <p>
        BBS is an abbreviation of "<a href="javascript:alert('The building that you can call-up bionic units')" id=“barracks”>Barracks</a>-<a href="javascript:alert('The building that you can call-up bionic units')" id=“barracks”>Barracks</a>-<a href="javascript:alert('The building adds 8 population')" id="Supply_Depot">Supply Depot</a>", you can use it to beat all kinds of races. Send your 6th <a href="javascript:alert('The basic unit gather resources')" id=“scv”>scv</a> and 8th <a href="javascript:alert('The basic unit gather resources')" id=“scv”>scv</a> to the center field of the map and build <a href="javascript:alert('The building that you can call-up bionic units')" id=“barracks”>barracks</a> there. You don't have to produce more than nine <a href="javascript:alert('The basic unit gather resources')" id=“scv”>scvs</a>. After building two <a href="javascript:alert('The building that you can call-up bionic units')" id=“barracks”>barracks</a>, send those <a href="javascript:alert('The basic unit gather resources')" id=“scv”>scvs</a> to search where's enemy base. When five <a href="javascript:alert('Basic bionic unit, HP:40')" id=“marine”>marines</a> are called-up, invade the enemy and set the rally of your <a href="javascript:alert('The building that you can call-up bionic units')" id=“barracks”>barracks</a> to enemy's front yard. Then, build <a href="javascript:alert('Defending building, you can put 4 marines as maximum')" id=“bunker”>bunker</a> and win the battle!
    </p>
    <h3 id="8_Barracks">8 Barracks</h3>
    <p>
        8<a href="javascript:alert('The building that you can call-up bionic units')" id=“barracks”>barracks</a> is a build that you building the <a href="javascript:alert('The building that you can call-up bionic units')" id=“barracks”>barracks</a> when your population number is 8. You may build the <a href="javascript:alert('The building that you can call-up bionic units')" id=“barracks”>barracks</a> on your front yard. After 2 or 3<a href="javascript:alert('Basic bionic unit, HP:40')" id=“marine”>marines</a> are produced, you can go on a rush. This build is usually used against zerg, and your purpose is canceling hatchery on enemy's front yard.
    </p>
    <h3 id="two_factories">Two factories</h3>
    <p>
        This strategy is used against terran or protoss. You need to build two <a href="javascript:alert('The building that you can call-up mechanic units')" id="factory">factories</a> before vitalizing your double <a href="javascript:alert('The building that you can gather mineral and gas')" id="command_center">command center</a>. It's very important not to show your strategy to the enemy, and act like you already vitalized the multi base. You can go on a rush after 3 <a href="javascript:alert('The strongest terran attacking unit, HP:150')" id="tank">seize tanks</a> are manufactured. Research for the mine as soon as possible, and research for the seize mode while producing <a href="javascript:alert('Mechanic unit that can implant spider mines, HP:75')" id="vulture">vultures</a>. It will be effective if you have some <a href="javascript:alert('Basic bionic unit, HP:40')" id="marine">marines</a>.
    </p>
    <h3 id="fake_double">Fake double</h3>
    <p>
        This strategy is used against protoss. It requires you to deceive your enemy. They might send their part of army to patrol and earn some information from you. You need to act as getting the multi <a href="javascript:alert('The building that you can gather mineral and gas')" id="command_center">command center</a> on your front yard. But, after manufacturing the <a href="javascript:alert('The building that you can call-up mechanic units')" id="factory">factory</a>, you need to research on mines and go on a rush when one <a href="javascript:alert('The strongest terran attacking unit, HP:150')" id="tank">seize tank</a> and six <a href="javascript:alert('Basic bionic unit, HP:40')" id="marine">marines</a> are engaged. Your purpose of this rush is make your enemy to abandon their front yard at least. If you fail to achieve this goal, your game will be hard to play.
    </p>
    <h3 id="two_barracks_aca">Two barracks one academy</h3>
    <p>
        You can choose this tactic when you finish the enemy zerg in 10 minutes. It's similar to what I mentioned right before. Build two <a href="javascript:alert('The building that you can call-up bionic units')" id=“barracks”>barracks</a>, but you must not show your second <a href="javascript:alert('The building that you can call-up bionic units')" id=“barracks”>barracks</a>. You need to build academy ASAP and research the steam-up. After all these procedures finished, go on a rush and seize the victory.
